# Turtle-Crossy-Road
This is a simple game GUI made using the turtle module in Python. It plays similarly to the famous Crossy Road game: a turtle (the player) has an initial position at the bottom of the screen. The goal of the game is to reach the very top of the screen by moving the turtle up with the UP ARROW key. When the player manages to reach the top part, he/she restarts at the bottom, and the level is incremented by 1. Of course, the player controlling the turtle has to make sure that it avoids upcoming obstacles ("cars") that are randomly generated. When the level gets updated, the cars also become faster. In case of a collision with a car, the game ends. 

To play the game, simply download all .py files and run the main file.

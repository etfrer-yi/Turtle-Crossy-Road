# Turtle-Crossy-Road
This is a simple game GUI made using the turtle module in Python. It plays similarly to the famous Crossy Road game: a turtle (the player) has an initial position at the bottom of the screen. The goal of the game is to reach the other end (the top part) by moving the turtle up with the UP key. Of course, the player controlling the turtle has to make sure that it avoids upcoming obstacles ("cars") that are randomly generated. In case of a collision with a car, the game ends.
